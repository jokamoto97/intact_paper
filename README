This directory contains all data and code necessary to reproduce the analysis from Okamoto et al. 2022. 
To run all analyses, first, be sure that you have the following software packages installed:

    bedtools (v2.22.0)
R packages:
    stringr (1.4.0)
    fgsea (1.12.0)
    tidyr (1.1.3)
    ggplot2 (3.3.6)
    dplyr (1.0.8)
    data.table (1.14.0)
    qvalue (2.18.0)
    SQUAREM (>= 2021.1),
    bdsmatrix (>= 1.3-4),
    numDeriv (>= 2016.8-1.1)

Then, execute

snakemake --cores 8 all


The above command reproduces each figure, table, and supplemental file from the manuscript. Results are generated in the output/ directory.






If you are interested in a certain part of our work, you can save time by only running parts of the analysis:


##Simulation analysis##:

snakemake simulation_study



##Hukku et al. data analysis (everything but the GO term enrichment analysis)##

snakemake real_data_hukku



##Hukku et al. data analysis (GO term enrichment analysis)##
*This step may take several hours to run

snakemake go_gse

snakemake summarize_go_gse



##Sinnott-Armstrong data analysis##

snakemake real_data_sinnott_armstrong_bedtools_intersect

snakemake real_data_sinnott_armstrong
