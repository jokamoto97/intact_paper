Supplementary Files 1-4 are raw independent GWAS hit files for each of the 4 traits, taken directly from the Sinnott-Armstrong et al. (2021) supplement. The {trait}_hits_hg38.bed files are the lifted-over files. Each Supplementary File was lifted over using the USCS Liftover tool found at https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver with default settings.

The file all_hits_miggenes_ext_hg38.bed file was generated by lifting over the original all_hits_misgenes.bed file from Sinnott-Armstrong et al., then extending each gene region by 100kb, truncating at chromosome ends.
